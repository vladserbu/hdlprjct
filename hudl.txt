As a Hudl Coach, I want to have the ability to update my team schedule, so that I can keep the team up to date if my schedule information changes. 

Coach Workflow


Scenario: An active user can retrieve the list of schedule entries.

Prerequisites:
API endpoint has a 'GET' method
A valid access token for the active user in the header

Expected result: Response HTTP 200 OK status code 


{

gameId: "1234567",

sqlId: "1234567",

date: "2016-01-01T19:00:00",

opponent: "TestOpponent",

opponentId: "123456",

isHome: true,

gameType: 0,

categories: [ ]

}

The user should see the date opponent, category in the FE. Id's should not be visible



Scenario: A valid user can update opponent entry 

Prerequisites:

API endpoint has a 'PUT' method

A valid access token for the user in the header

"opponent" value provided in the body:
opponent: "BCNOpponent"
Content-Type: application/json in the header


Expected result: Response HTTP 200 OK status code


{

gameId: "1234567",

sqlId: "1234567",

date: "2016-01-01T19:00:00",

opponent: "BCNOpponent",

opponentId: "123456",

isHome: true,

gameType: 0,

categories: [ ]

}

The coach should be able to se the updated opponent to BCNOpponent filed in the FE and a success message ex: "The team details has been updated"


Scenario: A valid user can create a new schedule entry

Prerequisites: 
API endpoint has a 'POST' method
A valid access token for the user in the header
Content-Type: application/json in the header

Body:

{
    "status": "live",

}

Expected result: Response HTTP 200 OK status code and the response should be updated with a new field in the JSON


{

gameId: "1234567",

sqlId: "1234567",

date: "2016-01-01T19:00:00",

opponent: "TestOpponent",

opponentId: "123456",

isHome: true,

gameType: 0,

status: live,

categories: [ ]

}

The new  "live" entry should be visible in the front end after is implemented 

Scenario: A valid user can remove "date" schedule entry
Prerequisites: 
API endpoint has a 'DELETE' method
A valid access token for the user in the header
Content-Type: application/json in the header


Expected result: Response HTTP 204 OK status code and the response should be updated with no data object in the JSON

{

gameId: "1234567",

sqlId: "1234567",

opponent: "TestOpponent",

opponentId: "123456",

isHome: true,

gameType: 0,

status: live,

categories: [ ]

}

The date field should be hidden on the FE side if it has been deleted in the BE

Negative results: 

I should get 404 response if the user does not exist
I should get 403 response if a current user has been disabled
I should get 401 response if the user auth has failed
I should get 500 response if the server there is a server error(no db connection)
